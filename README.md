# Strautomator Functions

These are Strautomator's functions that should be set to run on a scheduled basis, and depend on the [Strautomator Core](https://github.com/strautomator/core) to work. Some of these functions are required for core features to work (ie. GearWear mileage tracking, FTP auto-updating, etc), while others are optional (Strava cache cleanup, User subscription checks, etc).

They run in production via Google Cloud Functions + Cloud Scheduler, but should work just fine with other setups and environments as well.

The index.js file contain a sample of routines that should be executed on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.

## Local testing

Before you try to testing these functions locally, make sure you have followed the [Getting started](https://github.com/strautomator/core#getting-started) instructions to have all the required 3rd party dependencies ready.

## Deploying to production

The recommended setup is deploying these functions privately to Google Cloud Functions, and using Google Cloud Scheduler to trigger them on the desired schedule.
